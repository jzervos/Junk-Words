# Junk-Words
It could be useful to have code that randomly creates a junk file.
This should take input of amount of words and destination file.
Then randomly pick size of each word and randomly fill that word with characters.

As I progressed through this project, I broke it into more managable phases.  It is not that the project was unmanagable but to practice some of the senior concepts of software development that I had learned since first proposing the project.  This development took a more agile approach.  Using the method of breaking a project into smaller goals as learned in Operating systems, there is more of a sense of accomplishment as each goal is reached.
